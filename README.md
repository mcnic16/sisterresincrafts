[View live project]()


This website is the fully functioning website for SisterResin Crafts. Its is designed to be responsive for mobile and tablet and work on all modern browers.
The site has 6 pages consisting of a Home page, Other Items, Seasonal, Print on Demand, Reviews and Querys and a Terms and Conditions page.
There is also a Search bar, a registration page and the abiilty to buy items and to become an account holder. 
This is my 2nd attempt at this project, my previous attempt which was newsisterresincrafts completely stopped working, I had a problem with the header covering the products, but the more I tried to correct it, the worse it got. So for all previous git commits please see this project.
